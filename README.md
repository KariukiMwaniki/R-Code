# Africa Happiest Countries 

•	In 2021 the World Happiness Report was published and i was particularly interested in the happiness score of African countries.I took the complete data and cleaned it to only African nations.

 
•	I did a Linear Regression, Correlation and Decision Tree for the cleaned data then i visualized the Data to find the top 10 happiest countries in Africa and the top 10 saddest countries in Africa
