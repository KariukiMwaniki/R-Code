# Africa Happiest Countries 
# Project Overview 

•	In 2021 the World Happiness Report was published and i was particularly interested in the happiness score of African countries.I took the complete data and cleaned it to only African nations.

 
•	I did a Linear Regression, Correlation and a decision tree based on Generosity and the Happiness score of  the cleaned data.
