# Africa Happiest Countries 
# [Project Overview ](https://github.com/KariukiMwaniki/Africa-Happiness-Report-R-code--)

•	In 2021 the World Happiness Report was published and i was particularly interested in the happiness score of African countries.I took the complete data and cleaned it to only African nations.

 
•	I did a Linear Regression and Correlation of the cleaned data. I also did a decision tree which was based on the variables of Generosity and the Happiness score. 
•	Satisfied with the findings i visualized the Data to find the top 10 happiest countries in Africa and the top 10 saddest countries in Africa
